# Image Uploader
This project is a foundational Photo Uploader and Simple Gallery Web Application built using the powerful Python Django Framework. 
It provides a complete, secure system for users to upload images and view them in a basic gallery format.
​The application showcases essential web development concepts by integrating:
​Secure File Uploads: Robust handling of image files, ensuring they are correctly saved to the media directory.
​Image Model: Utilizes Django's ImageField to manage image metadata (title, description, timestamp) in the SQLite3 database.
